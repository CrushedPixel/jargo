TODO:
- support for namespaces
- change filter operator system from filter[attr:op] to filter[attr][op] for easier encoding on the client
- support for included values

- automatically create indices for sortable fields to improve pagination speed

Gotchas:
- only int64 ids are supported due to go-pg restrictions
- panicking in handler functions is allowed and handled
- inclusion of related resources is not possible (yet)

Ideas:
- add websocket support, mirroring all REST endpoints and adding PubSub capabilities
- add authentication system to avoid having to write one for every new app
- support for non-int64 ids
