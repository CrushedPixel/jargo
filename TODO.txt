- automatically create indices for sortable fields to improve pagination speed

- pagination system:
page[cursor] is the value of the last entry of the previous page.
the generated query looks like the one at http://leopard.in.ua/2014/10/11/postgresql-paginattion#.WiH5sLSFh24

- change filter operator system from filter[attr:op] to filter[attr][op] for easier encoding on the client

- only numeric ids are supported due to go-pg restrictions

Ideas:
- add websocket support, mirroring all REST endpoints and adding PubSub capabilities
- add authentication system to avoid having to write one for every new app
