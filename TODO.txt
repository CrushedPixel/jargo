TODO:
- fix internal server error if user filters by invalid value
- add support for wrapped types (type X int) in resource models.
  therefore, the converter needs to convert X to the (primitive) int type and back
  when converting from/to jsonapi model.
- !when converting resource to pg models, correctly set the ID field
- support for included values
- in the meantime, return 400 if include parameter is set
- support filtering by belongsTo relations
- proper logging
- automatically create indices for sortable fields to improve pagination speed
- more thorough unit testing
- prevent has/has relations as they can't be modeled in the database

Gotchas:
- only int64 ids are supported
- panicking in handler functions is allowed and handled
- inclusion of related resources is not possible (yet)

Ideas:
- add websocket support, mirroring all REST endpoints and adding PubSub capabilities
- add authentication system to avoid having to write one for every new app
- support for non-int64 ids
