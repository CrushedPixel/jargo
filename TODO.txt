TODO:
- relationships
- add custom error type translating into a pretty error response when called using ToErrorResponse
- change filter operator system from filter[attr:op] to filter[attr][op] for easier encoding on the client

- automatically create indices for sortable fields to improve pagination speed

Features:
- "jsonapi" struct tag allows for "readonly" tag now

Gotchas:
- only numeric ids are supported due to go-pg restrictions
- panicking in handler functions is allowed and handled

Ideas:
- add websocket support, mirroring all REST endpoints and adding PubSub capabilities
- add authentication system to avoid having to write one for every new app
- unify "jsonapi" and "jargo" struct tags
